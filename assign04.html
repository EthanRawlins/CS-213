      <br> <br>
      <h2 class="heading">Mission Statement</h2>
      <p>Our mission is to rethink and reinvent common household items to save you time to do the things that are most important to you.</p>
      <br> <br>
      <h2 class="heading">Our History</h2>
      <p>Innoventions, Inc. first started as a web development project for Ethan Rawlins, until he became the first human to ever invent time travel back in 2020. Not that it matters when, because he has taken his time machine to all periods of time, and has done more to advance technology than any other human. He brought the wheel to the Neanderthals, iphones to the ancient Greeks, and nuclear reactors to the Persians. He even went into the future and brought back hover cars and cold fusion to our present day.</p>
      <br> <br>
      <h2 class="heading">Our Facility</h2>
      <p>As you can see above, we have a state-of-the-art factory with thousands of employees to keep it running. If you are interested in working with us, please see the bottom of the page.</p>
      <br> <br>
      <h2 class="heading">Our Products</h2>
      <p>All this said, we at Innoventions, Inc., are extremely proud to announce a new chain of inventions from the future. You may have a hard time seeing their importance now, but how do you think the Neanderthals reacted? The same way you will when you see what we've got coming next from our brand new factory! You can find them wherever you buy things.</p>

            <blockquote class="span">This tool is a pen whose cap doubles as a usb flash drive. This product is perfect for the on-the-go business man, and the child who likes technology. It also will help you keep your files secret when the aliens take over using a zombie apocalypse to steal all your data.</blockquote>
